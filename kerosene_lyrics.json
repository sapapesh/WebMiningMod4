    "lyrics": "I'm waitin' on the sun to set cause yesterday aint over yet\r\nI started smoking cigarettes there's nothing else to do I guess\r\nDusty roads aint made for walking, spinning tires aint made for stoppin'\r\nI'm giving up on love cause love's given up on me\r\nI gave it everything I had and everything I got was bad\n\nLife aint hard but it's too long to live it like some country song\n\nTrade the truth in for a lie, cheating really aint a crime\n\nI'm giving up on love cause love's given up on me\n\n\n\nForget you high society, I'm soakin' it in Kerosene\n\nLight 'em up and watch them burn, teach them what they need to learn HA!\n\nDirty hands aint made for shakin', aint a rule that aint worth breakin'\n\nWell I'm giving up on love cause love's given up on me\n\n\n\nNow I don't hate the one who left\n\nYou can't hate someone who's dead\n\nHe's out there holding on to someone, I'm holding up my smoking gun\n\nI'll find somewhere to lay my blame the day she changes her last name\n\nWell I'm giving up on love cause love's given up on me\n\nWell I'm giving up on love HEY love's given up on me"
